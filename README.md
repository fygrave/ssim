Scalable Correlation Server for OSSIM (Open Source Security Information Management) Framework
===


This is an erlang/OTP based implementation of OSSIM event collection and correlation server.
It is intended to work directly with ossim-agent and does not require any additional OSSIM
 components (database, framework, UI are not needed).

The riak is being used as the primarily storage system and RabbitMQ is used as a messaging platform
between system components. Both components should allow endless horizontal scalability.

You will need:
    ossim-agent (http://alienvalut.com/download-ossim)
    riaksearch (http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search.html)
    RabbitMQ (http://www.rabbitmq.com/)

Basic architecture:


{ossim-agent}
{ossim-agent}        => {ssim_agent_server}
                                        <=> {rabbitMQ} <=> {ssim_correlator} <==> {riaksearch}
....                                                                                +-[ UI ]
{ossim-agent}        =>{ssim_agent_server}
{ssim_syslog_server} => ....

It is possible to cluster instances of ssim_agent_servers and ssim_correlators

To build and start server:
	$ mkdir deps ebin
	$ ./rebar check-deps
	$ ./prefetch_rabbit
	$ ./rebar get-deps
	$ ./rebar compile
	$ mkdir rel
	$ ../rebar create-node nodeid=ssim
	$ cd ..
	$ cp reltool.config rel/
	$ cp priv/app.config.sample rel/files/app.config
	$ rebar generate
	$ cd rel/ssim/etc
	<edit app.config to point to your riaksearch cluster and rabbitmq server>
	$ cd rel/ssim/bin
	$ chmod a+x ssim
	$ ./ssim start (or ./ssim console)
